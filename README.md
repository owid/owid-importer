A collection of Python bulk download and import scripts for various data sources written by Aibek Aldaberganov.

The scripts were previously in the [owid-grapher](https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher) repositoryâ€”we have since moved away from having everything in a single repository and moved away from Django, but we've kept the context of the scripts for easier maintenance.
